Principle developer on a cross-platform suite to integrate Linux and Windows-
based systems into a cloud computing infrastructure inside the Enterprise
Integration Labs. Initial work was on a C/C++ daemon suite to act as
counterpart to existing Windows C# service, however both were later scrapped
in favor of a unified Python-based cross-platform daemon/service which
performed the same roles as previous two applications. In the end, authored
39k lines C/C++, 18k lines BASH/shell, and 14k lines Python. Cross-platform
support included the Linux-flavors of  Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, SuSE,
SLES, SLED, Xen and ESX/ESXi, and the Windows-flavors of XP, Server 2003,
Vista, and 7. Leader of a team of engineers working on the cloud computing
project.
