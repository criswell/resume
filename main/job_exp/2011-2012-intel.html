  Principal developer on a cross-platform suite to integrate Linux and Windows-
  based systems into a cloud computing infrastructure inside the Enterprise
  Integration Labs. Initial work was on a C/C++ daemon suite to act as
  counterpart to existing Windows C# service, however both were later scrapped
  in favor of a unified Python-based cross-platform daemon/service which
  performed the same roles as previous two applications. In the end, authored
  39k lines C/C++, 18k lines BASH/shell, and 14k lines Python. Cross-platform
  support included the Linux-flavors of  Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, SuSE,
  SLES, SLED, Xen and ESX/ESXi, and the Windows-flavors of XP, Server 2003,
  Vista, and 7.
