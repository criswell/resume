  Manager responsible for build tools and processes, configuration and testing
  technologies, and repository policies and procedures. Set in place the
  branching, merge and repository workflow for the myriad of Git repositories
  in use at Angie's List. Integrated source code management tools with the
  build and test infrastructure. Managed merge queue and pull requests for
  diverse teams. Served as a liason between site-ops, dev-ops and development
  groups. Authored several Open Source tools and technologies which helped
  streamline the build and release process including git-circle, a Git
  extension for working with CircleCI. Designed and built the current
  Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana (ELK) stack for application and build logging.
  Helped reduce average build times from 2.5 hours down to 45 minutes.
