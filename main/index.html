    Dear web-weary soul,

    Hey, thanks for taking the time to look at the source-code to my resume,
    I'll admit I'm actually pretty proud of this and take delight at people
    trying to grok how it works.

    However, this resume is actually auto-magickally generated, thus I
    *really* wouldn't recommend taking at look at the resulting single HTML
    file.

    Instead, take a look at the source from which it was generated. This
    source can be found online at https://bitbucket.org/criswell/sam_resume .
    This online repo is actually a Mercurial (hg) repository, thus you will
    need a working hg install in order to check it out.

    Additionally, the resume is generated using a custom Jinja-based build
    script. So, in order to build it, you will want to have Python installed
    and the Jinja (http://jinja.pocoo.org/) module installed. The easiest way
    to do this in *my* opinion would be to use virtualenv, but I leave that as
    and excersize for the reader.

    But, for reference, the most current version of this resume can always be
    built using the commands (under a standard Linux/Unix system):

      hg clone https://bitbucket.org/criswell/sam_resume/
      cd sam_resume
      make clean ; make

    Again, thanks for the interest in my resume's source!

                - Sam
