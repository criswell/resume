    <p>Some short summary of things. You know, just a few lines, nothing special. Maybe
    include some BS about running the Olympics, even though it totally was that other guy.
    What you gonna do, call me out on it on national TV?!</p>
    <a href="#" onclick="unFlip('1');">Details</a>
    <p class="details" id="1">Some sort of extra details that would go into what what, in the butt.
    Honestly, typing all this crap is pretty lame, I should use "lorem ipsum" to fill it. Meh. I'll
    keep typing. Sad day when typing is seen as easier to moving your mose one window over to copy-
    pasta "lorem ipsum" text.</p>
